# Accessible Webpage for Marketing Agency (Horseon)

## Description

The aim of this project was to improve the accessibility of the Agencyâ€™s existing webpage. The motivations for this included ensuring that disabled users (customers) can access and use the site, optimising the site for search engines, and to meet accessibility standards (e.g. WCAG 2.2, 2023) and legal obligations.

Improvements included (but were not limited to): replacing `div` tags with semantic elements, adding alt text to images (using `alt` attribute), altering colour contrast to meet WCAG 2.2.2 (changing CSS styling), and fixing incomplete HTML bookmarks (using `id` attribute). (Note: HTML and CSS files are commented with a summary of all edits).

Other considerations were made, but later deemed not necessary. For example, existing font families and font sizes were considered for accessibility, but deemed no changes were required (i.e. all existing font families are sans-serif and minimum font size is 16px/12pt; both of which are typically considered accessible) (University of North Carolina at Greensboro, 2019; Accessible Web, 2023).
